# Buttercup Roadmap

Items and plans listed here are subject to constant change as developer availability changes and interests shift to different aspects of the platform. No dates or features listed here are promised in any way. They can be used as a rough guide to what is being developed, and what may be released in the not-so-distant future.

## Goal

The goal of MadDev Oy, the supporting company of Buttercup, is ultimately to **sustain** Buttercup as a free and open-source password manager. The majority of the Buttercup ecosystem will always be kept open, and free, where possible; but certain aspects of that ecosystem will need to be paid to support the company in _supporting_ Buttercup. Our password manager needs infrastructure, auditing, maintenance and developers working on it to keep it up to date, stable, safe and relevant.

MadDev Oy pledges to always keep currently-available free features **free** - Buttercup itself will always be free and open source. There _may_ be services that integrate with Buttercup, that are owned and operated by MadDev, that serve to act as a financial foundation for the software.
