# Buttercup Security Policy

## Supported Application Versions

Buttercup always recommends updating to the latest stable version whenever possible. Patches for previous versions than the current stable are usually not provided.

### Buttercup Desktop Application

| Version       | Supported |
|---------------|-----------|
| v2 current    | ✅        |
| v2 prior      | ❌        |
| v0 / v1       | ❌ ¹      |

Buttercup Desktop provides an auto-updater, which should be followed when new versions become available. It requires internet access to function.

**NB**: The portable releases do not auto-update, and so it is the responsibility of the user to freqently check for new releases.

### Buttercup Browser Extension

| Version       | Supported |
|---------------|-----------|
| v2 current    | ✅        |
| prior         | ❌        |

The browser extension is automatically updated via the browser vendor's systems. It is usually not required to check anything as the extension will update once a new release is published.

### Buttercup Mobile Application

| Version       | Supported |
|---------------|-----------|
| v2 current    | ✅        |
| v2 prior      | ❌        |
| v0 / v1       | ❌ ¹      |

The mobile application can be updated using the vendor's update systems (when using Google Play or Apple's App Store). If installed via some other method it is the user's responsibility to check for new releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take vulnerabilities very seriously, and appreciate discrete reports when possible to ensure adequate handling of the problem before it is widely known about. Sensitive issues should be reported privately to **info** _at_ **buttercup.pw**. Other issues can be followed up on GitHub.

Feature requests should always be made on GitHub and not via email.

## Notes

 ¹ Version / release unsupported, extremely outdated, immediate upgrade or disuse recommended.
