# Contribution Guide

Buttercup and MadDev welcome submissions of issues and changes/features - contrubitions are very much appreciated. All contributors must adhere to this guide, however, to avoid risk of banning or premature closing of issues/PRs.

## General

 1. Be respectful - Any rudeness or descrimination of _any_ kind can and will most likely be punished by banning the individuals responsible.
 2. Keep issues/PRs to-the-point. Both issues and PRs that address several to many points at once can be closed without notice.
 3. Duplicate issues/PRs will be closed without notice. Repeat infractions (failure to search) may be met with a ban.

## Issues

 1. Issues must be created in the correct project. We will (usually) no longer move them to the correct project, if they're created in the wrong place. Erroneous issues will be closed without notice.
 2. Issues without sufficient information will be closed without notice.
 3. Issues that are not reproducible will be closed. This is not to say that we don't acknowledge that there's an issue, but if we cannot reproduce the issue we cannot debug it. Users that can both reproduce the issue _and_ submit a PR are encouraged to do so as it means we can help see such work make it into production. If a user is willing to screen-share or provide us with a preview/temporary account to help us debug, we can sometimes assist without reproducing ourselves.

## PRs

 1. PRs that add a feature without first discussing it may be closed without notice.
 2. PRs that change a lot of files unnecessarily will most likely be closed. This includes PRs that make formatting changes.
 3. PRs where tests are failing can be closed without notice (unless marked as a WIP).
 4. Stagnant PRs will be closed at the discretion of the admins.
